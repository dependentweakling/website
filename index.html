        <p>I am a senior Cybersecurity student at Purdue University Indianapolis. With
            the skills I have acquired through my education, I aspire to join a national security
            taskforce and assist in protecting information databases.
            <br/><br/>
            Throughout my work at Purdue University, I have developed programs to assist in 
            automation and have built a network to simulate administrative security duties in a 
            business environment. Through these endeavors, I built a personal password
            manager to help me keep track of sensitive data offline. I plan to continue creating
            programs that will help myself and others combat ever-evolving security challenges.
            <br/><br/>
            I am a proud member of Girl Security, and strongly believe in the empowerment of women
            in the workforce. Furthermore, the current state of diversity produces a great opportunity
            for improvement.

        <p>My cybersecurity education at Purdue University Indianapolis delves 
            into programming, database management, web and application development,
            project management, networking, and cryptography.
            <br/><br/>
            Working skills for these specialties include knowledge with C, Java, Python,
            Bash, MySQL, Snort, and Autopsy. I have knowledge of Windows and Linux based 
            systems, though I am willing to learn any other operating system as needed.
            <br/><br/>
            I also learn on the TryHackMe platform to further my knowledge.
